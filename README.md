Plant monitor system using a WiFi development board, environmental sensors, and live data visualization 

## Overview

<br>
<br>
The goal of this project was to research the care requirements of a specific houseplant and build a system that would effectively monitor and report soil and environmental changes over time.
<br>
<br>
My plant was an **Aglaonema Red Star**, or **Chinese Evergreen**. Because of the red leaves it is **particularly sensitive to direct light**, significant temperature changes, and overwatering.
