</p>

The goal of this project was to research the care requirements of a specific houseplant and build a system that would effectively monitor and report soil and environmental changes over time.

### The Plant
My plant is an **Aglaonema Red Star**, or **Chinese Evergreen**. Because of its red leaves it is **particularly sensitive to direct light**, significant temperature changes, and overwatering. Some additional care specifications include:
<br>
- Temperature range from 15C - 25C
- Water 2x a week, waiting until top soil dries out
- Fertilize once a month

## Method

### Board Setup

1. The Feather Huzzah requires some additional setup when using it with the Arduino IDE. Visit the Adafruit site and [**download the SL driver**](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads) in order to add via the Board Manager. Once connected, [**add the ESP8266WiFi library**](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/latest/esp8266wifi/readme.html) to make it easier to connect your board to the internet.
2. Next add the [**PubSubClient library**](https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/) to enable simple publish/subscribe messaging with a server that supports MQTT. There are a handful of example sketches here that may be helpful to work through. Either create your own test server or download [**MQTT Explorer**](http://mqtt-explorer.com/) in order to start publishing your own messages. A great lightweight (no-code) solution can also be found at [**Adafruit IO**](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-io/mqtt-api).
3. A **very** important note: you will be using sensitive information in your sketch once you connect to your Wifi and MQTT server. **DO NOT share these in your code**-- create a separate header file that is included in your main sketch. When uploading to Github, add it to a ```.gitignore``` file.
```
// Wifi and MQTT
#include "arduino_secrets.h"

const char* ssid = SECRET_SSID;
const char* password = SECRET_PASS;
const char* mqttuser = SECRET_MQTTUSER;
const char* mqttpass = SECRET_MQTTPASS;
```
4. Now we're ready to add our sensors. Follow the schematic below:
![Project schematic](/assets/plantMonitor_schematic.png)
5. Run two test scripts ```testMoisture.ino``` and ```testTempHum.ino``` to see whether the sensors are working correctly. The environmental variable values are printed to both the ```console.log``` and serial plotter. 
6. You will need to **calibrate** the nail moisture sensor because soil depth, distance between the nails, and angle of incidence will all affect the quality of your readings. One way to prevent this is to create a mount or use a clip to keep the nails in place. [**This design**](https://github.com/ucl-casa-ce/casa0014/tree/main/plantMonitor/enclosure) was created by [**drvkmr**](https://github.com/drvkmr). I also marked the nails with a sharpie to ensure the soil depth was the same every time.

** ***The following steps are highly customizable to your own preferred setup-- if you want to send and store your plant's data, or be able to monitor it remotely using a gateway, you'll need a Raspberry Pi, CLI, database, and data visualization platform.*** **

8. A Raspberry Pi can be used as a gateway to send and store the plant monitor's data in the cloud-- if it's a new board, run the [**Raspberry Pi imager**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and download the appropriate version onto an SD card. Connect to your Raspberry Pi over SSH (secure shell protocol) using PuTTY as a command line interface. [**This tutorial**](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/raspberry-pi-headless-setup-how-to,6028.html) was very helpful. 

9. Next install InfluxDB from the command line (I used the Ubuntu & Debian 64-bit version). [**Here**](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.4/install/?t=Raspberry+Pi) are step-by-step instructions to get your database set up.

10. Finally, [**install Grafana**](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/) as a data visualization tool for your live data. [**This**](https://university.influxdata.com/cour) tutorial was very helpful with learning the basics and making custom queries. 

## Results

### Data Visualization

| _***InfluxDB***_ | ![InfluxDB](/assets/InfluxDB.png) |  |

### Observations
Once data feeds are up and running, monitor over a period of time to determine desired value ranges for each sensor in regards to the plant's preferred growing conditions. A regression curve analysis can be used to smooth out moisture sensor readings over time, allowing you to determine a regular watering cycle for the plant.

Also pay attention to where the plant and sensor are physically placed in a room or environenment, as external factors can influence the readings as well (ie. close to a window that opens, a classroom that fills with people, etc).

### Challenges
- Moisture sensor nail calibration was difficult and minute differences in the positioning of the device can cause big discrepancies in values returned
- The nails are predisposed to corrode during the electrolysis process, limiting life time  
- Overall system energy consumption is very high, and relies on constant power
- Limited mobility: need to be in range of a network or reconfigure devices if connected to a new network

### Suggested Improvements
- Greener energy consumption: regenerative energy source such as solar/wind, or only send and received messages when the value of the sensor changes within a predetermined range amount
- Design a closed loop system: negate the need for a "smart" or "connected" device by designing feedback loops that tend to the plant's required needs around temperature, humidity, and moisture
- Add additional sensors such as a [Adafruit VEML7700 Lux Sensor](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-veml7700-lux-sensor-i2c-light-sensor?variant=21801832448083) to monitor environment and activate an [LED grow light](https://www.onestopgrowshop.co.uk/grow-lights/grow-lights-led-grow-lights.html) for dark winter months
