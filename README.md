## Overview

</p>

The goal of this project was to research the care requirements of a specific houseplant and build a system that would effectively monitor and report soil and environmental changes over time.

### The Plant
My plant is an **Aglaonema Red Star**, or **Chinese Evergreen**. Because of its red leaves it is **particularly sensitive to direct light**, significant temperature changes, and overwatering. Some additional care specifications include:
<br>
- Temperature range from 15C - 25C
- Water 2x a week, waiting until top soil dries out
- Fertilize once a month

<br>
The Feather Huzzah requires some additional setup when using it with the Arduino IDE. Visit the Adafruit site and [download](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/using-arduino-ide) the driver in order to add via the Board Manager. <br>
Once connected, the next step is to connect the board to the internet using your local connection.

## Results
- Show screenshots
### Data Visualization
- MQTT Setup
- Raspberry Pi Gateway
- InfluxDB
- Grafana

## Challenges
- moisture sensor calibration and design flaws
- moisture sensor calibration necessary
- constant power needed for system, needed to disconnect to move to my home environment 

## Next Steps
- greener energy consumption
- make a closed loop system
- add watering/other passive sensors?
- integrate disturb counter sensor
