# ðŸŒ± plantMonitor
Plant monitor system using a WiFi development board, environmental sensors, and live data visualization 

## Overview
![Project Cover Photo](/assets/plantMonitor_Cover.jpg)

The goal of this project was to research the care requirements of a specific houseplant and build a system that would effectively monitor and report soil and environmental changes over time.
### The Plant
My plant was an **Aglaonema Red Star**, or **Chinese Evergreen**. Because of its red leaves it is **particularly sensitive to direct light**, significant temperature changes, and overwatering. Some additional care specifications include:
<br>
- Temperature range from 15C - 25C
- Water 2x a week, waiting until top soil dries out
- Fertilize once a month
